     <!-- We have already created our very first Vue app!
    This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template,
    but Vue has done a lot of work under the hood.
    The data and the DOM are now linked,
    and everything is now reactive.
    How do we know? Open your browser’s JavaScript console (right now, on this page) and set app.message to a different
    value.
    You should see the rendered example above update accordingly. -->

    <div id="app">
        <!--  v-bind : Here we are encountering something new.
        The v-bind attribute you are seeing is called a directive.
        Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue,
        and as you may have guessed,
        they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.
        Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s title attribute up-to-date with the message property on the
        Vue instance.” -->
